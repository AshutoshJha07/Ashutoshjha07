### Hi, I'm Ashutosh Jha üëã

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Science Consultant who thrives on transforming complex data into tangible business solutions. For me, data science isn't just about models and metrics; it's about bridging the gap between technical possibility and real-world impact.

This philosophy has guided my professional freelance career, where I've delivered numerous data science projects for clients, earning a **Top-Rated badge on Upwork** with a **100% Job Success Score** and a perfect **5.0-star rating**.

### üöÄ My Work in Action

Here's a glimpse into how I approach problem-solving:

<details>
<summary>üèÜ <strong>From Messy Data to a Winning Strategy</strong></summary>

I led my team to **1st Place in the Data Quality Assurance Challenge** at the Data Science Summit '23. We tackled a complex dataset from a major insurance company, engineering an automated preprocessing pipeline to systematically handle missing data. The core of our winning solution was a Random Forest Classifier that predicted missing information with **97.11% accuracy**. `[https://github.com/AshutoshJha07/DATA-QUALITY-ASSURANCE-CHALLENGE-FOR-AN-INSURANCE-COMPANY]`

<details>
<summary>üß† <strong>Pushing the Boundaries of Deep Learning for Lip-Reading</strong></summary>

In a challenging personal project, I pioneered an **end-to-end video classification pipeline in PyTorch** to read lips from silent video clips. By developing a custom 3D CNN and implementing advanced optimization techniques like Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), the model achieved **55% accuracy‚Äîmore than 25 times better than a random baseline**. `[Link to Repo]`
